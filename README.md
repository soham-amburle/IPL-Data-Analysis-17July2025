# IPL-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IPL match data using Python. The project covers key insights like top players of the match, toss impact, batting first vs batting second outcomes, team-wise win patterns, and season/city-based trends. Includes a focused segment analyzing Sunrisers Hyderabad's performance when they won both the toss and the match.

# IPL Data Analysis

This project analyzes Indian Premier League (IPL) match data using Python and pandas.

## üìÅ What's in this repo?
- `ipl_data.py`: A Python script that reads IPL match data, filters for specific teams, and performs basic analysis including:
  - Team performance summaries
  - Win counts and win percentage
  - Season-wise insights

## üìä What I used:
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (or PyCharm)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Analysis Examples:
- Matches where teams scored more than 200 runs
- Filtering wins by specific teams like SRH (Sunrisers Hyderabad)
- Finding out win percentages for teams across seasons
