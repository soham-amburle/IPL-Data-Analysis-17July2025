Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IPL match data using Python. The project covers key insights like top players of the match, toss impact, batting first vs batting second outcomes, team-wise win patterns, and season/city-based trends. Includes a focused segment analyzing Sunrisers Hyderabad's performance when they won both the toss and the match.
