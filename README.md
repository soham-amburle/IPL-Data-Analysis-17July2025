# IPL Data Analysis 
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IPL match data using Python. It delves into patterns, trends, and insights from past seasons, highlighting top players, the impact of toss decisions on outcomes, and how different teams perform when batting first versus chasing. There's also a special spotlight on Sunrisers Hyderabad and how they fare when they win both the toss and the match.

- `ipl_data.py`: A Python script that processes and analyzes IPL match data. It includes:
  - Team-wise performance breakdowns
  - Win counts and percentages
  - Season and city-level trends

---

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or **PyCharm** for script editing)

- Matches where teams scored more than 200 runs
- Team-specific win analysis (e.g., SRH)
- Toss influence on match results
- Win percentages across seasons
